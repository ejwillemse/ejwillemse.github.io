AI model to calculate minimum resource requirements for laboratory tests

Developed an optimisation model to determine the minimum number of resources required to perform work tasks. The tasks involved a series of hands-on and equipment specific processes. The model was used to calculate the minimum required resources, thus minimise cost, and to produce a work schedule with shift rosters and task assignments. The model was further used to identify high-risk periods where resources were at full capacity, which, in turn was used to assign back resources for the periods. The model was thus used to minimise cost whilst ensuring that the resulting assignment were robust enough for implementation.

## Whole sale plant nursery business improvement

**Date**: Apr 2012 - Jun 2012

**Employer**: LTS Health, South Africa

**Type** Consulting

Business improvement project for plant nursery operations

For this project I was responsible for conducting a business process improvement project at a wholesale plant nursery situated in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The aim of the project was to identify and improve processes that would have the greatest impact on the performance of the company. The main Industrial Engineering techniques that I used were business process mapping and data analysis.

I used business process mapping to understand all the operational areas of the company, and to identify areas for improvement. I then applied data mining and business analytics on the company’s sales data by using ABC analysis to identify the top products and customers of the company. Next, I applied business analytics to automatically detect negative customer purchasing behaviours that indicates that a key client was likely to stop purchasing at the company. Through the analysis, order returns were identified as a major concern for the company. I used the same analysis to identify critical customers with high return rates, enabling the company to agree on quality standards with the company, thus reducing product returns.

In addition to the data analysis, I also developed plant inventory models to assist the company in better planning its production runs. The ABC product analysis was further used to relocate high demand products to centrally located storage areas. Lastly, the data analysis was used to determine the optimal vehicle delivery fleet size and usage patterns.

In addition to the technical components of the project, I was responsible for all client interaction, including the scoping of deliverables, facilitating client workshops, compiling of the final project documentation, and presenting the final recommendations to the client for approval.

My involvement was as the senior process engineer for the process Manage Technical Data. Our team’s task was to develop the sub-processes, tasks, activities, key performance Indicators and supporting systems and artefacts for the process. The team further had to identify and establish all the interfaces with other processes.

My specific role was to manage the process team, ensuring that the process was developed and approved by Eskom, on time and in line with the overall Back2Basics project objectives. As such I reported directly to the project manager for the Perform Technical Management function. I was further responsible for facilitating the team workshops, and for applying process improvement principles during the development of the process.

## Waste collection and transportation optimisation - Implementation

Jan 2008 - Mar 2012

**Employer**: Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), South Africa

**External clients**: OXFAM Italia, South Africa, Ekurhuleni Municipality, South Africa.

**Type** Applied research and consulting

AI for waste collection optimisation

Based on initial needs assessment, a three-year project was scoped to develop the optimisation models and algorithms, and to use the models to improve the collection processes of a municipality. The project focused on four areas of waste collection and transportation planning: generating optimal daily collection routes for vehicles whilst minimising the required fleet size; sectoring a collection area into balanced collection days; determining the optimal collection fleet size composition; and determining the optimal placement of intermediate facilities and transfer stations. The models and algorithms were implemented at Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality in the areas of Watville and Actonville.

For implementation at Ekurhuleni Municipality, the existing waste collection and transportation processes of the Metro waste analyses. The analyses were then used to develop the collection system requirements, constraints and objectives, which were then used as input to the optimisation models and algorithms. The algorithms were used to develop improved collection routes for the Municipality, thus allowing the Municipality to better plan its waste collection activities. The implementation at Ekurhuleni was used to develop a business case and for future waste collection and transportation optimisation projects. A road map was also created, stipulating the creation of a decision support system to assist municipalities with their planning activities.

Part of a CSIR research team that assisted ESKOM (South African electricity public utility) in improving their electricity capacity expansion planning. The key activities of the project were to improve the utility’s existing planning efforts, and to identify and evaluate new expansion planning methods. My tasks were, firstly, to identify improvements in the Utility’s existing planning methods, focussing specifically on its planning software, and to conduct workshops to implement the improvements. My second task was to implement and test improved expansion planning optimisation models, identified by the Utility; and then in conjunction with the project team, to evaluate the models and report the results to the customer.

## Integrated renewable energy systems modelling

**Date**: Nov 2008 - May 2009

**Employer**: Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), South Africa

**Type** Applied research

Simulation model and P&L analysis for integrated renewable energy system

The objective of the project was to develop simulation model of an integrated sustainable technologies system. The technologies modelled included a concentrated solar power plant, agriculture and aquaculture plants, and bio-diesel and biogas production facilities, with their respective technology readiness levels ranging from mature to conceptual. The simulation model was developed to generate and evaluate different system setups, and to determine the financial viability of constructing and operating such a system at a rural town.

The sustainable technologies were primarily linked to the following disciplines: electrical, electronic, mechanical and systems engineer; environmental and micro biology; and architecture. My task was to gather technical and costing data for each technology from domain experts, and synthesise the data so that it could be used in a single simulation model.

The operational logic and process flow of each of the technologies were modelled, with input from domain experts, and integrated using systems dynamic simulation software. The simulation model was verified by comparing the simulated output against international case study data of existing systems. For conceptual technologies still under development, the outputs from the model were evaluated by subject matter experts.

After the simulation model was verified, the costing information of the technologies were linked to the simulation model output to create an income statement. All capital costs were annualised using a standard discount factor and combined with the simulated operational costs and incomes to populate the income statement. The statement, linked with the simulation model was then used to economically evaluate different system setups.

## Security guard routing optimisation

**Date**: Jan 2007 - Dec 2008

**Employer**: Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), South Africa

**External client**: Midfield Estate, South Africa

**Type** Applied research

AI model for security route planning

The objective of the project was to improve the security system of Midfield-Estate, a security estate situated in Gauteng, South Africa, by developing optimisation algorithms capable of generating unpredictable patrol routes for security guards. The resulting routes that the algorithms generated made the patrolling of the estate unpredictable, resulted a significant improvement in the even patrolling of the road network, and resulted in a more balanced work distribution among guards. For the project, the following tasks were performed:

Data gathering and analysis: A Graphical Information System Software package (ArcGIS) was used to capture the estate’s road network, and to analyse the effectiveness of the existing patrolling. The analyses were then used to identify improvement opportunities and to formulate the main objective functions by which to measure the effectiveness of patrol routes.

Algorithm development: Optimisation algorithms, incorporating elements of artificial intelligence, were developed capable of generating patrol routes for security guards. The algorithms addressed all the objectives identified in the data analysis phase and were benchmarked using international data sets to ensure that they produced high quality routes.

Implementation: For the final phase of the project, multiple routes were developed for the security estate. The efficiencies of the routes were measured using the developed objective functions and compared against the existent routes. Detailed maps and routing instructions were developed and presented to the Estate’s security management for final implementation.
